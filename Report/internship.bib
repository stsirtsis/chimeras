	abstract = {The phase oscillator model with global coupling is extended to the case of finite-range nonlocal coupling. Under suitable conditions, peculiar patterns emerge in which a quasi-continuous array of identical oscillators separates sharply into two domains, one composed of mutually synchronized oscillators with unique frequency and the other composed of desynchronized oscillators with distributed frequencies. We apply a theory similar to the one which successfully explained the onset of collective synchronization in globally coupled phase oscillators with frequency distribution. A space-dependent order parameter is thus introduced, and an exact functional self-consistency equation is derived for this quantity. Its numerical solution is confirmed to reproduce the simulation results accurately.},

This result, together with recent studies on multiple chimera states in nonlocally coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, provide strong evidence that the phenomenon of chimeras may indeed be relevant in neuroscience applications. Moreover, our work verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable elements, whereas to date chimeras were known to arise in models possessing a single stable limit cycle. Finally, we have identified an interesting class of mixed oscillatory states, in which desynchronized neurons are uniformly interspersed among the remaining ones that are either stationary or oscillate in synchronized motion.},

	abstract = {The synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fascinating manifestation of self-organization that nature uses to orchestrate essential processes of life, such as the beating of the heart. Although it was long thought that synchrony and disorder were mutually exclusive steady states for a network of identical oscillators, numerous theoretical studies in recent years have revealed the intriguing possibility of “chimera states,” in which the symmetry of the oscillator population is broken into a synchronous part and an asynchronous part. However, a striking lack of empirical evidence raises the question of whether chimeras are indeed characteristic of natural systems. This calls for a palpable realization of chimera states without any fine-tuning, from which physical mechanisms underlying their emergence can be uncovered. Here, we devise a simple experiment with mechanical oscillators coupled in a hierarchical network to show that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns. We identify a wide spectrum of complex states, encompassing and extending the set of previously described chimeras. Our mathematical model shows that the self-organization observed in our experiments is controlled by elementary dynamical equations from mechanics that are ubiquitous in many natural and technological systems. The symmetry-breaking mechanism revealed by our experiments may thus be prevalent in systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as power grids, optomechanical crystals, or cells communicating via quorum sensing in microbial populations.},
