Plan (Stratis Tsirtsis)

- Reproduce results for spot chimera in 2D LIF paper
- Optimize algorithm
- Use verious optimization rules and report benchmarks
- Parallelize the program in C
  a) case of many runs (different initial conditions)
     running in parallel
  b) case of the main routine (double do loop) running
     in parallel
- Report benchmarks and best-faster algorithm (12-15 pages)
- Present your report in 20 min talk to the group.
